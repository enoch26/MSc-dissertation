This is a repository for my dissertation at University of St Andrews 2018-2019. 

The project title is "Modelling the prognosis from colorectal cancer on the basis of image analyses". The data consists of information regarding tumour budding, immunoscores & the spatial interactions of the lymphocytes to the tumour buds â€“ all derived from image analysis of tissue. As it is a multivariate dataset, I have first implemented frequentist and machine learning approaches in order to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. Then, I classify patients with higher risk of mortality with the testing data and assess the performance based on the validation data.
